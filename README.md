- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sergei2010
Two and a half years ago, I started working in the IT field as a JavaScript developer. 
My previous job required me to be responsible, accurate, able to concentrate on a specific task,
have a good memory, logical thinking and analytical mindset. 
I am constantly continuing to study and build up my competencies. I have experience in commercial development. 
Now I can not just make an interface, but also thanks to my knowledge of JS and Backbone
End, I understand my work at the Full Stack level.
Everything is just beginning!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning course author Vladilen Minin
'JavaScript Junior FrontEnd Developer'
- 💞️ I am looking for opportunities to collaborate on creating visual components of applications
using the React Single Page Application framework, writing Back-End and Rest APIs with the MongoDB database.
